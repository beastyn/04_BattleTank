1. Concept

   It was a long-last fight. You`ve lost all of your comrades and so have your rival. 
Now it is just you and your enemy and... your tanks. 
Use your strategic mind and landscape to bring victory to you homeland!

2. Rules

* 1 vs 1
* Player and AI have limit health and ammo.
* One hit - one damage point.
* No hits through obstacles like hills or rocks.
* Game over with 100% lost in player health.
* Game over with 100% lost in player ammo.
* Game wins If AI lost his health or ammo.
* Player aims with circle.
* When circle is on the target its color should be changed.
* There is time delay before the next shot.
* Aiming can be with sniper mode but slower moving.
* Player and AI can repair a tank with special kit, but it makes a tank moving slower.
* Some speed logic. Tank have acceleration and decelleration.
